# INTRODUCTION

Every new product that is to be developed needs to have a plan in order to not fail during its production. In fact, according to Clayton Christensen, a Harvard Business School professor:
>Out of all the new items that are introduced to the market each year, 95% of them end up failing.

With that said, let’s explain what a **Production Plan** document (also known as Production Roadmap)  is, seeing it’s utilities and contents.

### ***Main purpose***

The main purpose of a Production Plan is to define a production strategy to develop a product or a part of it, taking into consideration the available resources, expected deadlines, how the budget should be managed, the target audience, and other important production information.

This is a very brief explanation of its main use, but the document also serves other important purposes that we’ll see later on.

### ***What does it contain?***

In order to accomplish its objectives, a Production Plan must contain different elements. These may vary depending on what the document is looking to accomplish. It could be a product features plan, a release plan or a sprint plan to name a few. Nevertheless, they all share some common elements, which are:
- An **objective** (build a release, implement a feature, etc...)
- The **tasks** needed to be done to fulfill the objective
- A **deadline** to accomplish it
- How **resources** are going to be managed on each task

It’s important to point out that resources don’t only mean money and time, but also people, software, hardware, and anything needed to develop the task.

### ***How and why is it useful?***

Building a plan for the production of your product is key in its development process because it provides a bunch of benefits, such as:
- Not having to rely on memory to know what you are supposed to do
- Everything gets documented so you can retrieve information at any time and, in case something goes wrong, you can see why that - happened
- It helps team organization
- It allows to minimize expenses and maximize profits by managing resources and budget correctly

Another important use of this document is to help investors be confident in the project, giving them a clear image of how everything is going to be done, and creating expectations on how the product is going to be on certain deadlines.

### ***How and when it should be updated?***
A Production Plan update rate is highly dependent on the size of the project that’s been developed. Let’s see this on an schematic way:
- Small project (up to 6 months): monthly update
- Medium project (1-2 years): quarterly update
- Big project (>2 years): yearly update

This is a huge simplification on how it generally works, but there’s other ways to check when to update. In video games, two examples of these could be:
- Update after each sprint meeting
- Update after each release

However, there's certain situations that will always force us to update the document. The most remarkable one is when there is a change on the budget or the deadlines. In this situation, a reorganization of resources is needed and, in most cases, we will have to leave aside some features of our product.

The way it should be updated is by communicating with the different departments to see what their capabilities are and how any problems that may appear, or already exist, can be solved.
It is also important that any important member of the company is present in this process as they are the ones with bigger knowledge on how the production should go, and could contribute with valid ideas and solutions.

One last thing that needs to be mentioned is that even when the product makes it into the market, it will probably still receive updates and new features. That means that the Production Plan should keep being updated.
